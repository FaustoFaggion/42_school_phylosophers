##Thread X Process

- Threads run inside a process
- Threads share the same process so:
  - have the same memory space
  - The variables of the process are comom for all threads. All threads can acess the same variables.
  - As the varibles are comom you have to make sure when a thread is changing a variable the other threads can't acess the variable.
- Threads shate the same file handlers.
- All the system resources are shared among the threads.

- Process run independily from others process
  - Have independent memory space
  - When create a process, the parent variables are duplicated for the child process.
  - Changes in variables on the parent process don't afect the variables in the child process.
- File handlers are duplicated.
